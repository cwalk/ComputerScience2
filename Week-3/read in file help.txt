1.Read each test-case into a string using nextLine().
2.Split the string into an array of strings, using the String method split(). For the parameter, you choose an expression by which to split the string, so use the white-space delimiter, or just " ".
3.Parse each string element into an integer, using the Integer method parseInt(), and store them into your integer array.

From the Scanner class, utilize hasNextLine() and !hasNext("\n") to read to end of each line

One (outer) scanner scans in the lines using hasNextLine() then another (inner) scanner that scans the ints in each individual line using hasNextInt().
